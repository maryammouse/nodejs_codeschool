Having learned the basics of AngularJS I have migrated to learning Node.js.

AngularJS is a Javascript web framework.

Node.js is a Javascript runtime. Having never worked with a runtime before (and therefore with code at such a low level) Node.js seems a bit daunting. But I will work through it and I will understand!
